# Android-Dice-Roller


The aim is to create an interactive Dice Roller app that lets users tap a Button composable to roll a dice. The outcome of the roll is shown with an Image composable on the screen.

I used Jetpack Compose with Kotlin to build the app layout and then wrote business logic to handle what happens when the Button composable is tapped.



Defines composable functions.
Creates layouts with Compositions.
Creates a button with the Button composable.
Imports drawable resources.
Displays an image with the Image composable.
Makes an interactive UI with composables.
Uses the remember composable to store objects in a Composition to memory.
Refreshes the UI with the mutableStateOf()function to make an observable.
